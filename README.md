# Welcome to UBR Project (Utrecht Bicycle Repair)

This project was created with MERN stack [To view the LIVE SITE, click here](https://ubr-bike-repair-shop.web.app/).

I hosted my front-end on firebase, and backend on heroku, then used mongodb atlas as a database.

other than that, i have also used react router, express, bootstrap and various other dependencies to make this project realistic.

if you wish to work on it even more, feel free to do so... 

just don't take the credit for my work... :/

## Follow the step below >>

In the project directory, you have to run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

ofcourse i am assuming you know how to work with react and github... 

## `Enjoy!`
